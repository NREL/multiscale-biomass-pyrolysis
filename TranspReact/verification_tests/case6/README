#Solving electrode-electrolyte system
d/dx(-sigma dphi/dx)=0
phi(0)=1 phi(1)=0
sigma=3.0 for x in [0,0.2) (electrode)
sigma=1.0 for x in [0.2,1] (electrolyte)
At the interface a BV condition is applied
-sigma dphidx (left) = j0*sinh((phi_electrode-phi_electrolyte-ocp)/phi0)
= -sigma dphidx (right)

In this case, a cell mask is 
applied in in [0,0.2) and 
IB method is used.

Potential is then solved 
inside the solid (cell mask=0) using
iterative conjugate solves.

There is a right case as well which is the mirror image 
of the left case.

Note that the BV current is always directed from 
electrode to electrolyte
